# ip2country2020
IP-to-country lookup demo

Compile with: javac ip2c.java (using JDK 8 or higher)
Make sure IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB1.CSV.ZIP is unzipped into current directory.

Then run with, e.g.: java ip2c 8.8.8.8

This demonstrates a nice little algorithm to do an efficient binary search in a text file.

Cheers
